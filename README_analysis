how to use the analysis.py script:

	1) Make input file.
		
	This *must* contain the cube entire path and an output name. The header *must* contain the keywords:

		cube_path	output_name

	To keep tracks of things, it's advisable to keep also a 'ZAP_mask' column.

	In order to keep it reasonable tidy, the output_name must be

		Cluster name + some that says what the cube is (e.g. ZAP,CubeSharp,CubeFix_ZAP,ZAP_exp1...)

	***There is a full list of the available images already done. Use this to make the input for --compare
	and update this after a --images ***

	
	2) Make fits images

	python analysis.py --images=True input_list

	It produces a new folder in /data/vera/DataQuality/output_name
	
	it will crash if it already exists (it's on purpose...)
	
	and some Narrow band, Medium band and spectra

	
	3) Produce Pdf

	python analysis.py --compare=True --mask='ZAP_mask.fits' input_list

	produces a pdf with the results
